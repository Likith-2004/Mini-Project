# Sleep Detection and Mitigation System

This project is a **Sleep Detection and Mitigation System** designed to monitor an individual's drowsiness levels and provide alerts or interventions to help them stay awake. It is particularly useful for applications in driving, workplaces, and other situations where prolonged alertness is critical.

## Project Overview

The **Sleep Detection and Mitigation System** uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze video or sensor data to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, yawning, or head nodding. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers alerts or activates mitigation actions to help the individual regain alertness.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Drowsiness Detection**: Continuously monitors signs of drowsiness in real-time.
- **Customizable Alert System**: Sends alerts such as audio alarms, vibrations, or notifications.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately predict drowsiness.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable for different environments such as vehicles, workspaces, or homes.

---

## Architecture

The architecture includes the following components:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Captures video or sensor data for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes the raw data for input to the detection models.
3. **Sleep Detection Model**: Analyzes input data to detect drowsiness in real-time.
4. **Alert System**: Triggers mitigation actions such as audio alarms or notifications when drowsiness is detected.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sleep-detection-mitigation.git
    cd sleep-detection-mitigation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the required models** (if applicable):
    - Place the models in the `models/` directory.

---

## Usage

1. **Start the Detection System**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Adjust Settings** (optional):
    - Modify alert preferences or detection sensitivity in the `config.json` file.

3. **Monitor Output**:
    - Real-time output will display on the screen or be logged in `output/logs/`.

### Command Line Arguments

- `--video`: Specify a video file for analysis.
- `--live`: Use live video from a webcam.
- `--config`: Path to configuration file.

Example:
```bash
python main.py --live --config config.json
