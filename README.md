## Abstract
This project applies CNNs to detect oil spills in images from diverse environments. The model’s high accuracy in identifying oil spills across various tests highlights its robustness, making it a reliable option for environmental monitoring.

## Introduction
Oil spills are hazardous to marine and coastal ecosystems, and current detection methods often require substantial resources. This project introduces a machine learning-based solution to automate oil spill detection, improving scalability and reliability in identifying spills across different scenarios.

## Related Work
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of CNNs, ResNet, and transfer learning for environmental pattern recognition in images. This project extends these techniques to enhance feature extraction specifically for oil spill detection.

## Methodology
The project methodology involves:
- **Data Acquisition:** Collecting a labeled dataset of oil-spill and non-oil-spill images.
- **Model Design:** Building a CNN architecture optimized for feature extraction and classification.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Fine-tuning the model to maximize accuracy and minimize false positives.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images representing various marine environments. Data is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

## Preprocessing
Image preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques such as rotation and flipping to enhance model generalization and robustness.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by pooling and dense layers. A final softmax layer outputs the probability of the image containing an oil spill.

## Evaluation Metrics
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **AUC-ROC**

These metrics collectively measure the model’s effectiveness in minimizing false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy.

## Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy and precision, with a confusion matrix and ROC curve indicating strong performance across various test conditions. This effectiveness suggests it is suitable for practical environmental monitoring applications.

## Conclusion
The project underscores the potential of deep learning for automated oil spill detection. The model’s successful identification of oil spills across diverse environments indicates its viability for real-world deployment in environmental monitoring and disaster management. Future enhancements may include real-time integration and dataset expansion.
